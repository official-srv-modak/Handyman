2. Open the `handyman_home.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## HTML

The HTML files (`handyman_home.html`, `Assembly.html`, `handyman.html`, `move.html`) structure the content, including the header, introduction, service sections, testimonials, and contact form.

## CSS

CSS styles are divided into separate files (`styles1.css`, `styles2.css`, `styles3.css`) to maintain clarity and organization. The styles define the visual presentation of the website, including colors, fonts, and layout.

## JavaScript

The `script.js` file contains JavaScript code for three main functionalities:
- Sticky header effect on scroll.
- Form validation for the contact form.
- Testimonial rotator to cycle through pairs of testimonials.
